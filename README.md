<br> 👥 I’m open to  
- Meeting other beginners  
- Collaborating on small learning-based projects  
- Exploring open-source step by step

<br> 🤝 I’m looking for help with  
- Understanding layout and design basics

- Hosting my first project on GitHub or Netlify

<br> 💬 Ask me about  
- What I’m learning as a web dev beginner
